## 🎨 Logo Tips for Best Results

### Social Media Sharing
Your logo will appear when people share your site on:
- Facebook (1200x630px preview)
- LinkedIn (1200x630px preview)
- Twitter/X (large card preview)
- WhatsApp (thumbnail)
- iMessage (link preview)

### File Optimization
Use online tools to compress your logo:
- **TinyPNG** - https://tinypng.com (best for PNG)
- **Squoosh** - https://squoosh.app (Google's image optimizer)

**Goal:** Keep under 100KB for fast loading

### Logo Best Practices
✅ **DO:**
- Use transparent background (if PNG)
- Ensure text is readable at small sizes (40x40px in header)
- Keep aspect ratio 1:1 or 16:9
- Use high contrast colors

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use gradients (can look pixelated when scaled)
- Include tiny text (won't be readable)
- Use too many colors (keep it simple)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Logo Still Not Showing After Placing File?

**Check these:**
1. **Filename:** Must be exactly `logo-optima.png` (lowercase, hyphen)
2. **Location:** Must be in `public/` folder (not `public/images/` or elsewhere)
3. **Restart server:** Stop dev server (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again
4. **Hard refresh browser:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` to clear cache
5. **Check browser console:** Press F12 → Console tab → Look for 404 errors

### Still Getting 404 Error?

Run this command to verify file exists:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\eduar\OneDrive\Desktop\Optima Service Gourp"
Get-ChildItem public\ | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "logo-optima.png" }
```

If nothing appears, the file isn't there yet!
